# Personal Potions - Health Data Flow & Security Requirements

## üè• HIPAA Compliance Overview

Personal Potions processes **Protected Health Information (PHI)** including medical conditions, dietary intake, physical characteristics, and health goals. This document outlines our data flow architecture and security requirements to ensure HIPAA compliance.

---

## üìä Health Data Categories

### **Category 1: Personally Identifiable Health Information**
- Age, weight, biological sex
- Medical conditions (hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, etc.)
- Menstrual symptoms and reproductive health data
- Sleep disorders and issues

### **Category 2: Lifestyle & Behavioral Health Data**
- Activity levels and exercise patterns
- Dietary intake patterns (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium)
- Sleep goals and patterns
- Alcohol consumption (hangover-related data)

### **Category 3: Supplement & Medication Data**
- Current supplement intake levels
- Health condition management requirements
- Contraindications and safety considerations

## üîÑ User Data Flow Architecture

### **1. Data Collection Phase**
```
Frontend Survey (Public) ‚Üí Input Validation ‚Üí Temporary Storage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Basic Demographics (age, weight, sex)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Health Conditions Array
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dietary Intake (dual format support)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Goals & Preferences
```

**Current Implementation:**
- 5-step survey with progress tracking
- Client-side validation before submission
- No user authentication required initially
- Data temporarily held in browser state

**Security Gap:** No encryption during collection phase

### **2. Data Processing Phase**
```
API Request ‚Üí Rate Limiting ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Calculation Engine ‚Üí Response
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ POST /api/formula/calculate
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ POST /api/intake/validate  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POST /api/intake/convert
```

**Current Security Measures:**
- Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- Request size limits (50KB max)
- Input validation with type checking
- Error logging without exposing PHI

**Processing Data:**
- Intake values converted to mg amounts
- Health conditions mapped to multipliers
- Safety limits applied based on conditions
- Formulation calculations performed

### **3. Data Storage Phase**
```
Calculation Results ‚Üí Database ‚Üí User Account (Future)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Currently: No persistent storage implemented
```

**Current State:** 
- Database schema exists but no PHI storage implemented
- Results temporarily returned to frontend
- No user account or session management

## üîê Security Requirements for HIPAA Compliance

### **Administrative Safeguards**

#### **1. Security Officer Assignment**
- [ ] Designate HIPAA Security Officer
- [ ] Implement security incident response procedures
- [ ] Create workforce training program
- [ ] Establish access management protocols

#### **2. Access Management**
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Create unique user identification system
- [ ] Establish automatic logoff procedures
- [ ] Implement audit controls

### **Physical Safeguards**

#### **1. Server Environment**
- [ ] Secure hosting environment (AWS/GCP with HIPAA BAA)
- [ ] Physical access controls to data centers
- [ ] Workstation security controls
- [ ] Device and media controls

#### **2. Data Center Requirements**
```yaml
Environment Requirements:
  - HIPAA-compliant hosting provider
  - Business Associate Agreement (BAA) signed
  - SOC 2 Type II certification
  - Regular security audits
```

### **Technical Safeguards**

#### **1. Access Control (¬ß 164.312(a))**
```typescript
// Required Implementation
interface AccessControl {
  userAuthentication: "Multi-factor authentication required";
  roleBasedAccess: "Minimum necessary principle";
  sessionManagement: "Auto-logout after inactivity";
  auditLogging: "All PHI access logged";
}
```

**Current Gap:** No authentication system implemented

#### **2. Audit Controls (¬ß 164.312(b))**
```typescript
// Enhanced Logging Required
interface AuditLog {
  userId: string;
  action: 'CREATE' | 'READ' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE';
  resource: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  phiAccessed?: string[];  // Types of PHI accessed
  outcome: 'SUCCESS' | 'FAILURE';
}
```

**Current Implementation:** Basic error logging exists, needs PHI-specific audit trail

#### **3. Integrity (¬ß 164.312(c))**
```typescript
// Data Integrity Measures
interface IntegrityControls {
  dataValidation: "Input sanitization and validation";
  checksums: "Data integrity verification";
  versioning: "Change tracking for PHI";
  backupValidation: "Regular backup integrity checks";
}
```

#### **4. Transmission Security (¬ß 164.312(e))**
```typescript
// Required Security Headers (Enhancement Needed)
const securityHeaders = {
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'",
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'
};
```

**Current Implementation:** Basic security headers exist, needs enhancement

## üö® Critical Security Gaps

### **1. Encryption Requirements**
```typescript
// MISSING: End-to-end encryption
interface EncryptionRequirements {
  dataAtRest: "AES-256 encryption for database";
  dataInTransit: "TLS 1.3 minimum for all communications";  
  fieldLevel: "PHI fields individually encrypted";
  keyManagement: "AWS KMS or equivalent key rotation";
}
```

### **2. Authentication & Authorization**
```typescript
// MISSING: User management system
interface AuthenticationSystem {
  userRegistration: "Email verification required";
  multiFactorAuth: "SMS or app-based 2FA";
  passwordPolicy: "Complex passwords with rotation";
  sessionSecurity: "Secure session tokens with expiration";
}
```

### **3. Data Minimization**
```typescript
// PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED: Needs enhancement
interface DataMinimization {
  collectionPurpose: "Only collect necessary PHI";
  retentionPolicy: "Auto-delete after specified period";
  anonymization: "Remove identifiers when possible";
  consentManagement: "Explicit consent for each data use";
}
```

## üîç Monitoring & Compliance

### **Required Audit Trail Elements**
```sql
-- Audit Log Schema
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  action VARCHAR(50),
  resource_type VARCHAR(50),
  resource_id UUID,
  phi_types TEXT[], -- Array of PHI categories accessed
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  outcome VARCHAR(20),
  error_details JSONB
);
```

### **Monitoring Alerts**
```yaml
Alert Conditions:
  - Repeated failed login attempts (5+ in 10 minutes)
  - Unusual data access patterns
  - Large PHI data exports
  - API rate limit violations
  - Failed encryption/decryption attempts
  - Unauthorized access attempts to admin functions
```

### **Compliance Reporting**
```typescript
interface ComplianceMetrics {
  dataBreaches: number;
  unauthorizedAccess: number;
  dataRetentionCompliance: percentage;
  auditLogCompleteness: percentage;
  encryptionCoverage: percentage;
  userTrainingCompletion: percentage;
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

### **High-Risk Areas**
1. **Unencrypted PHI transmission** (Current)
2. **No user authentication** (Current)  
3. **Limited audit capabilities** (Current)
4. **No data retention controls** (Current)
5. **Client-side PHI storage** (Current)

### **Medium-Risk Areas**
1. **Basic rate limiting** may not prevent sophisticated attacks
2. **No automated backup verification**
3. **Limited error handling** could expose system details
4. **No real-time monitoring** of security events

### **Mitigation Strategies**
```typescript
interface SecurityMitigation {
  immediateActions: [
    "Enable TLS 1.3 across all endpoints",
    "Implement request signing for API calls", 
    "Add comprehensive input validation",
    "Remove client-side PHI persistence"
  ];
  shortTermActions: [
    "Deploy authentication system",
    "Implement field-level encryption",
    "Add real-time monitoring",
    "Create incident response procedures"
  ];
  longTermActions: [
    "Obtain HIPAA compliance certification",
    "Implement zero-trust architecture",
    "Add advanced threat detection",
    "Regular penetration testing"
  ];
}
```
